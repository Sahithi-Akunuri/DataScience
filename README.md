# Python with DataScience

This is one of my best internships. During my internship at Teachnook in collaboration with Wissenaire (IIT Bhubaneswar), I had the opportunity to work on a Python-based data science project. I gained hands-on experience in utilizing various data science libraries and tools to analyze and derive insights from real-world datasets. The internship not only enhanced my technical skills but also allowed me to learn from experienced mentors and be part of a prestigious institution's research environment.
